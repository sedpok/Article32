	<p><font size="+4">T</font>his is the only thing to do to have a good and clean website and in the future, <b>a lot of traffic will depend of that practice</b>. 
	When people talk to me about removing bad backlinks, I'm always a little curious about how the person might want to do it. 
	<u>How do you know which backlinks to remove?</u>  Many times, they mention the Google guidelines as reference on what 
	to keep and what to remove.<br><br>
	Unfortunately, this is the mistake of many, as many backlinks that are theoretically considered "black hat" by Google <u>seems not to 
	be harmfull at all for your PageRank</u> or your site's authority. In fact <b>those backlinks are worth for good and reliables!</b> Google's
	policies are designed to keep Google a relevant and quality search engine, but the reality of 430 billion sites competing for the top
	results means that it cannot penalize those sites as described. Yet we still see people cutting the "link juice" of certain backlinks which
	actually destroys their SERPs and causes them a big loss of rankings. Most of the cases they don't even understaind why.</p>
